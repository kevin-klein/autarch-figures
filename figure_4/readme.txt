Start docker desktop.

Use your favorite command line (e.g. Powershell) to run this:
$ cd [current folder, e.g figure_4]
$ docker compose up

The docker image will automatically take a screenshot of these page:
http://localhost:3000/maps?tag_id=3&commit=Search
http://localhost:3000/publications/1/radar
http://localhost:3000/publications/6/radar

The resulting files can be found in the output folder. They were then manually edited to the figure in the paper.
